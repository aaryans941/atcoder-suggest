# atcoder-suggest

A web application made in Flask, aiming to suggest problems in a desired rating range for a user, using [Kenkooo](https://github.com/kenkoooo/AtCoderProblems) API.

Future work : ~~Extend to multiple users to support Mashups/Lockouts, to suggest virtual contests for multiple users~~, add more filters for selecting problems, extend to discord bot for community use.
